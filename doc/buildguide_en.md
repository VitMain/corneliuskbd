# Build Guide
## Checking the package contents
When you open the box, first make sure all the contents are included.

__Keyboard case body__.

The top and bottom bodies are screwed together with spare screws beforehand.
Please remove the screws and check the inside.

![Package Body 001](images/package-body001.jpg)

The inside of the case and other parts that are not visible from the front when assembled may have some scratches or may not be painted sufficiently.
In most cases, this is difficult to prevent due to the manufacturing process, so we appreciate your understanding.
Also, please refer to the following for the clearance between the E-White case and each part and how to deal with it.

## The clearance between the E-White case and each part and how to deal with it

For E-White, some changes were made to the coating process at the GB manufacturing stage to improve quality.
As a result, the surface texture and the white color have been greatly improved.

However, this has resulted in a thicker coating surface than before, which has caused a lack of clearance for some parts.
Specifically, interference may occur between the top body and bottom body, and between the top body and switch plate, depending on the combination of the machining accuracy of each part.

If you are concerned about interference, or if an assembly is difficult, please refer to the following solutions.
Please check and deal with them before assembly.
Additionally, some of them have been handled for us before shipment.

### How to deal it

The following areas are prone to interference.
Please check the interfering parts and remove about 0.1mm-0.2mm with a file to solve the problem.
The degree of shaving varies depending on the individual unit, so please check each time while working to avoid over-shaving.
I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

## Check PCB operation

Before you start assembling, please make sure that the PCB is working properly.

We recommend you to use [VIA](https://caniusevia.com/) or [Remap](https://remap-keys.app/) to check the operation, since VIA-compatible firmware has already been written.

## Install the gasket foam.

Install the gasket foam on the bottom body and the top body.
You can also install it on the switch plate instead of the case.

![Install Gasket](images/install-gasket001.jpg)

When removing the gasket foam, be careful not to tear the foam.
Also, there is adhesive tape on one side of the gasket foam. Depending on how you remove it, the adhesive side may remain on the filme side, so it is recommended to carefully remove it with tweezers.

## Installing the switch

For the polycarbonate plate, there is a protective film on both sides, so carefully peel it off.

![Polycarbonate plate Peel films off](images/polycarbonate-plate-peel-films-off.jpg)

The polycarbonate plate has a glossy side and a semi-glossy side. The two sides of the plate are the same, so you can use whichever side you prefer.

![Polycarbonate plate Glossy](images/polycarbonate-plate-glossy.jpg)

![Polycarbonate plate Semi-Glossy](images/polycarbonate-plate-semi-glossy.jpg)

Insert the switch foam between the PCB and the switch plate, and then attach the switch.

![Install Middle foam](images/install-middle-foam.jpg)

When attaching the switch, press it straight down from the top.
Place the PCB on a flat surface as shown in the photo, and push it in from directly above for easier insertion.

![Install Switches 002](images/install-switches002.jpg)

If you are using a solderable board, you can also solder it here.

## Case assembly

The weights on the bottom body are initially attached with silver screws.
You can change them to black screws if you like.

![Change black screws](images/change-black-screws.jpg)

Put the bottom foam on the bottom of the bottom body, and put the PCB on top of it.

![Install a bottom foam](images/install-bottom-foam.jpg)

![Build a case 001](images/build-case001.jpg)

Install the top body straight from the top and while holding the top body by hand to prevent it from coming off, attach the screws from the back.
There are some combinations of top and bottom bodies that a little tight.

Attach cushion rubbers.

Finally, attach the key cap to complete the process.
