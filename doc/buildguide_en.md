# Build Guide
## Checking the package contents
When you open the box, first make sure that all the contents are included.

__Keyboard case body__.

The top and bottom bodies are screwed together with spare screws beforehand.
Please remove the screws and check the inside.

1. Photo (case body)

The inside of the case and other parts that are not visible from the front when assembled may have some scratches or may not be painted sufficiently.
In most cases, this is difficult to prevent due to the manufacturing process, so we appreciate your understanding.

## Check PCB operation

Before you start assembling, please make sure that the PCB is working properly.

We recommend you to use [VIA](https://caniusevia.com/) or [Remap](https://remap-keys.app/) to check the operation, since VIA-compatible firmware has already been written.

## Install the gasket foam.

Install the gasket foam on the bottom body and the top body.
You can also install it on the switch plate instead of the case.

When removing the gasket foam, be careful not to tear the foam.
Also, there is adhesive tape on one side of the gasket foam. Depending on how you remove it, the adhesive side may remain on the filme side, so it is recommended to carefully remove it with tweezers.

## Installing the switch

For the polycarbonate plate, there is a protective film on both sides, so carefully peel it off.

The polycarbonate plate has a glossy side and a semi-glossy side. The two sides of the plate are the same, so you can use whichever side you prefer.

Insert the switch form between the PCB and the switch plate, and then attach the switch.

12. Photo (PCB, foam, and plate stacked on top of each other)

When attaching the switch, press it straight down from the top.
Place the PCB on a flat surface as shown in the photo, and push it in from directly above for easier insertion.

If you make a mistake and the foot of the switch is bent, use pliers to straighten it out and reinsert it.

If you are using a solderable board, you can also solder it here.

## Case assembly

The weights on the bottom body are initially attached with silver screws.
You can change them to black screws if you like.

Put the bottom foam on the bottom of the bottom body, and put the PCB on top of it.

Install the top body straight from the top.
Depending on the combination of each part, the plate may interfere with the top body.
However, if you are concerned about this, please consider shaving about 0.1mm-0.2mm off the plate side.

18. Photo (Top body installation)

While holding the top body by hand to prevent it from coming off, attach the screws from the back.
There are some combinations of top and bottom bodies that a little tight.

Finally, attach the key cap to complete the process.
